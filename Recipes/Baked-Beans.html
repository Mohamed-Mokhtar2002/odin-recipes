     <h2>A Note From Our Recipe Tester</h2>
        <p> "These baked beans from scratch are made by combining navy beans, <br> molasses, and maple syrup to make this classic dish at home." <br>—Tara Omidvar</p><br>
     <h3>Ingredients</h3><br>
       <ul>
         <li>1 cup navy beans, soaked overnight and drained</li>
         <li>4 cups water</li>
         <li>¼ cup ketchup</li>
         <li>¼ cup maple syrup</li>
         <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
         <li>2 tablespoons molasses</li>
         <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
         <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
         <li>⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
         <li>⅛ teaspoon chili powder</li>
         <li>1 small onion, chopped</li> 
       </ul><br>
     <h3>Steps</h3>
       <ol>
          <li>Once beans have simmered for 1 hour, drain, and reserve cooking liquid. Pour beans into a 1 1/2-quart casserole dish; stir in chopped onion and molasses mixture. Stir in enough reserved cooking liquid so sauce covers beans by 1/4 inch. </li>
          <li> Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Stir ketchup, maple syrup, brown sugar, molasses, Worcestershire sauce, salt, pepper, and chili powder together in a small bowl; set aside.</li>

          <li>Cover and bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes; reduce heat to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C) and cook 6 hours longer, stirring beans after they have cooked for 3 hours. Once beans are tender and sauce has reduced and is sticky, remove from the oven, stir, recover, and allow to stand 15 minutes before serving. </li>
