        <p> "This Moroccan soup is bold, rich, and full of flavor.<br> An ultimate comfort food for winter nights. The recipe is very straight-forward. <br>You can make a big batch and freeze it to enjoy anytime that you want." <br>—Tara Omidvar</p><br>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3><br>
        <ul>
           <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
           <li>1/2 pound lamb, beef, or chicken, cut into 1/2-inch pieces</li>
           <li>6 large tomatoes, peeled, seeded, and pureed</li>
           <li>1 large onion, grated</li>
           <li>1 stalk celery with leaves, finely chopped</li>
           <li>3/4 cup dried chickpeas, soaked overnight and peeled</li>
           <li>1/4 cup finely chopped fresh parsley leaves</li>
           <li>1/4 cup finely chopped fresh cilantro leaves</li>
           <li>1 tablespoon kosher salt</li>
           <li>1 tablespoon ground ginger</li>
           <li>1 tablespoon smen, optional</li>
           <li>1 1/2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper</li>
           <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
           <li>1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric, or 1/4 teaspoon yellow food coloring</li>
           <li>11 cups water, divided</li>
           <li>3 tablespoons dried lentils, soaked overnight</li>
           <li>3 tablespoons tomato paste, mixed into 1 cup water</li>
           <li>2 tablespoons raw rice, or 2 tablespoons broken vermicelli</li>
        </ul><br>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather the ingredients. </li>
            <li>Heat the oil in a 6-quart or larger pressure cooker on medium-high. Add the meat. Cook for a few minutes, stirring to brown all sides. </li>
            <li>Add the pureed tomatoes, onion, celery, chickpeas, parsley, cilantro, salt, ginger, smen, if using, black pepper, cinnamon, and turmeric. Stir and add 3 cups of the water. Cover tightly and heat over high heat until pressure is achieved. Reduce the heat to medium and cook for 20 to 30 minutes. Remove from the heat and release the pressure. </li>
            <li>Add the lentils, tomato paste mixture, and the remaining 8 cups of water. If at any point there's an oily surface forming on top of the soup, simply skim it off and discard. This can happen because of the meat's fat, if left on. </li>
            <li>Have the rice or vermicelli at hand, if using, but don't add yet</li>
            <li>Cover the pot and heat the soup over high heat until pressure is achieved. Reduce the heat to medium and continue cooking</li>
        </ol>
